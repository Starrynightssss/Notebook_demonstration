Query: "Summarize this document"
Response: "This document is a report on customer churn analysis for ABC E-commerce, a leading online retailer. The report aims to analyse customer data to understand churn behaviour, develop predictive models, and recommend data-driven strategies to improve customer retention.

### Task 1: Understanding Customer Characteristics

The report uses Excel and Tableau to understand the characteristics of churned, non-churned, and high-value customers. 

**Key findings** from this analysis include:

* **Tenure:** Non-churned customers have a significantly higher average tenure than churned customers, suggesting that longer tenure correlates with customer loyalty. High-value customers also have a higher average tenure.

* **Preferred Payment Type:** The use of debit and credit cards is prominent in both churned and non-churned high-value customers. However, card use is more prevalent among non-churned customers, indicating that high-value customers who stay with the company may be more comfortable with these conventional payment methods. More churned customers prefer e-wallets, suggesting a lack of digital incentives might contribute to churn.

* **Average Order Count:** High-value customers have a higher average order count, aligning with their status as frequent buyers.  A slight drop in the frequency of purchases among churned customers could be an early warning sign of churn.

* **Satisfaction Score:** Surprisingly, churned customers have a higher average satisfaction score than non-churned customers. This suggests that satisfaction scores alone may not be a reliable predictor of churn.

* **Days Since Last Order:**  Non-churned high-value customers tend to have engaged with the company more recently than churned high-value customers. This suggests that recent engagement is a strong indicator of retention among high-value customers.

### Task 2: Predictive Modelling

The report develops and evaluates three predictive models to assess customer churn:

* **Decision Tree Model:** 
    * The most important variables in this model are tenure and complaints. 
    * Customers with low tenure who have made complaints, and customers with low tenure who prefer specific product categories (Fashion or Mobile Phones) are most likely to churn. 

* **Regression Model:**
    * The most significant variables in this model are complaints, the number of devices registered, marital status (married), cashback amount, and city tier.

* **Neural Network Model:**
    * The most influential variables in this model are gender (female), city tier, tenure, preferred order category (mobile phone and laptop & accessory), and preferred payment mode (e-wallet).

The report then evaluates the models using various metrics, including ROC (AUC), lift, misclassification rate, and average squared error.

* **Neural Network** performs best across all metrics.
* **Regression** performs slightly below the Neural Network.
* **Decision Tree** ranks lowest in terms of predictive accuracy.

Despite the superior performance of the Neural Network, the report recommends the **Decision Tree model** as the best choice for ABC E-commerce due to its **high interpretability** and **actionable insights**, which can guide targeted interventions.

### Task 3: Campaign Recommendations

Based on the insights from Task 1 and Task 2, the report recommends the following campaigns:

* **Welcome and Onboarding Program for New Customers:** To increase engagement and satisfaction among new customers.

* **Complaint Resolution and Satisfaction Improvement Program:** To address customer complaints promptly and improve satisfaction scores.

* **Loyalty Program Tailored to Payment Preferences and Product Categories:** To retain customers who are more likely to churn due to payment preferences or specific product categories. 

These recommendations are supported by research and best practices in customer retention. "
